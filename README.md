- there is one controller all with GET methods to hit the producer. It has nothing to do with Kafka.
- There is a service that actually listen to the producerKafka Topic when ever you hit http://localhost:8081/hit/2, http://localhost:8081/hit/22, http://localhost:8081/hit/7 , http://localhost:8081/hit/77. This service receives the serialized Object then consumes it after deserializing.
